# awk-glib
ANSI graphics library (in gawk)

This graphics library can load, save, copy (with transparency and clipping), flip and draw the buffered output in multiple ways to the terminal without you having to think about how it's done.<br>
All in awk with ANSI escape codes!

Just run example <code>./gtest.sh</code>, <code>./animate.sh</code> or <code>./picview.sh <image.ext></code> and see the results<br>

Here are two static image of some result:<br>
